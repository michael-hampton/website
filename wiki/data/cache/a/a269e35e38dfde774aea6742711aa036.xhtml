Process supervisors are users who have special privileges to oversee and review the cases of a particular project. Often the manager or department head in an organization will be assigned as a process supervisor. 
Process managers have special privileges to do actions such as
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">  reject</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> abandon</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">  hold </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> review a case if it has failed validation rules. </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Process management rights can be assigned to teams or users.

Normal users can also be given permissions within a step  which means they can fill in a form and save/complete but cant do any of the above. There is also the ability for a user to claim a step if this has been set up as a condition. This means that anyone can claim a step and work on it.
