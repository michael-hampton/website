<strong>Data Reporting Tools</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Data Reporting tools allows users to create their own custom reports which can then be viewed and exported. This wizard provides an interactive UI for cresting reports. The builder provides the user with a variety of options for creating order by clauses and where conditions and allows users to choose which columns and tables should be displayed within the report. Once created a preview of the report will be displayed which can then be exported to a CSV file.
