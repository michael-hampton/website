<strong><abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> Monitor</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> Monitor connects to a specified <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> Server and downloads CSV files from a given directory. 
</p>

<p>
Each CSV file will contain the required information required to complete the task (as if the user was filling out a form)
</p>

<p>
For each valid csv file found a new case will be created and will be routed to the second task of the process. The file is stored in the new case as an input document. The <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> monitor will connect and download each time the cron job is run.
