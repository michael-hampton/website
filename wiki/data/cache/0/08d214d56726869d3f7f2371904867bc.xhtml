16.3Calendars
Calendars allow process designers to specify the hours and days when users are expected to be at work, so that the due dates for tasks can be more accurately calculated with Timing Controls. They also allow holidays to be specified, so those days are excluded when calculating the due date. Different calendars can be created for different needs. For instance, a calendar can be created that only includes workdays, but not holidays or weekends, which is useful for calculating salaries.
Calendars can be created for specific processes, tasks and users. Therefore, processes can use different calendars when calculating due dates for their tasks. Likewise, users in different sections or regions of an organization can use different calendars.
