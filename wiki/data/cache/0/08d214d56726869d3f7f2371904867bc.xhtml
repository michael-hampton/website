<strong>Calendars</strong>
 Calendars allow the user to specify which hours and days the users are expected to be at work, so that the due dates for tasks can be more accurately calculated with Timing Controls. They also allow holidays to be specified, so those days are excluded when calculating the due date. 
</p>

<p>
Calendars can be created for specific processes, tasks and users. Therefore, processes can use different calendars when calculating due dates for their tasks. Likewise, users in different sections or regions of an organization can use different calendars.

  * Description: A description of the calendar, which should inform the user about the general content or purpose of the calendar.
  * Active: Select whether the calendar is enabled or disabled.
  * Work Days: The days of the week to be included in the calendar can be selected here. To enable the checkboxes to select the days of the week, the option Work Hours must be unchecked:</strong></em>Underlined Text<em class="u"></em>

Work Hours: This group is a table where as many rules as needed can be defined to determine the work hours in each day. The grid has three columns: Day, Start and End.
