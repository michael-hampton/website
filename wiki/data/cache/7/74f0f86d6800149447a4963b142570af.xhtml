Message types allows you to create groups of message fields which can be used to send “messages” between two processes. It allows you to create variables which holds data or form field values wich can be sent to another process.
The first required field is “Name”, which means adding a name to identify the “Message Type” being created.
The next, also required, field is “Message Field Name”. In this particular field, enter a unique name to identify the variable. The name must be a valid PHP variable name, which starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers or underscores. Spaces, symbols and international letters whose value is greater than 255 are not allowed. Then click on “Create” and the new variable will be added to the list of “Message Type” variables. Create as many new variables as needed.
