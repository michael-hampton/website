<strong>Script Task</strong>
</p>

<p>
This type of task allows a trigger to be executed when the flow arrives to that task. Some of the characteristics of a script task are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> oWhen the task is ready to start, the engine will execute the script.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> oWhen the script is completed, the task will also be completed.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
After adding a script task to the design, configure it by going to its properties to add the code that will be executed.
