<strong>Web Entry</strong>
Web Entry allows anonymous, external users to initiate new cases from an external web page without the necessity of manually logging into EasyFlow. Web Entry provides a web link or the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code of a form in the first task of a process. The user fills out this form and submits the data back to Easyflow. It can only be used to start cases.

The name of the first field is “Step” and it is a required field. When a Web Entry is created, the user will be redirected to the form for this step.
The next required field is “Users”. Choose the person who will initially be assigned to the new case. The orange icon with a question mark indicates the description of the field. This field works like a search box; try adding a letter and a user that starts with that letter will appear in the suggest box.
Web Entry Type: Select whether the Web Entry form will be based upon:
Dynamic PHP:
Static <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>: This option only generates the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code for the form,.
Generate the Web Entry by clicking on the button marked as “Save”. This link can be used to access the form added in the Start Event.
