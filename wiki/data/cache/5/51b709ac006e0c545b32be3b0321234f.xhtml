Variables
</p>

<p>
Variables are column names which hold pieces of data  used to populate fields in the forms. When a step is saved it will first check to see if the field exists within the pre-defined object and if not it will check to see if it has a variable set up for it. If it doesnt the step wont save. Each variable can be assigned a validation type.
