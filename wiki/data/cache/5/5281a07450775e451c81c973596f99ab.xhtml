<strong>Overview</strong>
</p>

<p>
Only people who are registered as users have the right to access EasyFlow. Those users can be organized into groups and departments. The type of activities that users can perform and the interface users see is determined by their roles.
</p>

<p>
The Users Tab
</p>

<p>
To administer users, groups and departments, log in as the “admin” or another user who has the PM_USERS permission in their role. Then, go to the Users tab in the sidebar under the Admin menu:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> User: A user account in EasyFlowusually represents a person in the organization, but can also represent an account with special privileges, such as the “admin” account.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Groups: Users can be assigned to a group. A group of users simplifies the assignment of users to tasks. For example, a “Help Desk” process may involve a pool of customer support clerks, all belonging to a group named “Customer Support”.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Departments: Arranges users under a hierarchical organizational structure. A user can only belong to one department.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Roles: Makes it possible to define customized roles with different levels of permissions, so that the functions and privileges of different users can be easily controlled and managed.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Groups are a way to organize users and to simplify the assignment of tasks to multiple users. In the Purchase Request example process, the “Initiate task” task can be assigned to the “Employees” group, which would includes everyone in the organization. That way, anyone in the organization is able to start a Purchase Request case. If the organization has two accountants and both are assigned to the “Generate Receipt” task, then an “Accountants” group can be created and assigned to the task rather than assigning each accountant individually. Assigning groups, rather than individual users, will eliminate a lot of hassle for process designers, since it can be difficult to remember to include every individual user when assigning tasks.

<p>
A user account can belong to a group, and groups can have multiple users. In other words, many groups may be assigned to many users. The Users column displays how many users are assigned to a group, and the Tasks column shows how many tasks the group has been assigned to.
</p>

<p>
To add a user to group, first select the group in the list. Then, click on the Users button at the top of the list. A new window will appear:

</p>

<p>
Departments are another way to organize users based on an hierarchical organization that determines the manner and extent to which roles and responsibilities are delegated, controlled, and coordinated, as well as how information flows between levels of hierarchy in a company. In EasyFlow, departments should represent the units in the organization, and the employees of each entity (that will work in processes of the company) should be assigned to these departments. Creating the departments and setting the managers (optional) for each department will indicate to who employees should report to when submitting information that needs revision or approval from a supervisor according to the hierarchical organization of the company.
</p>

<p>
To manage departments go to to user admin screen and click on the department tab
</p>

<p>
For departments, take into account the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Users can only be assigned to one department.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Departments can not be assigned to tasks.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If a step fails validation then the department manager will have to approve the step.</div>
