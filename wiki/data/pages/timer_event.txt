**Timer Start Event**
The Timer start event automatically starts new cases at specified times. These cases can be programmed to be started on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis, or one time only.
A process containing a Timer start event must have at least one task. The first task after a Timer start event needs to be assigned to at least one user. Timer start events do not work correctly if the initial task is a script task.
