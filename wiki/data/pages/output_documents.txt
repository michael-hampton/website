**Output Documents**

Output Documents are files generated while running a case, which are meant to be printed out or stored digitally. Output Documents are useful for creating external records of case data, as well as creating formatted documents such as letters, bills and receipts. Output Documents are generated from HTML templates and can contain variables, which are auto-inserted when the Output Document is generated as a step when running a case. Output Documents are generated as PDF (Portable Document Format) and/or DOC (Word document)files, so they can be easily opened and printed using Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Office.
If the Output Document is generated as a PDF file, the TCPDF library can be used to generate the PDF file.
