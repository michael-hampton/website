**Output Documents**

Output Documents are files generated while running a case, which are meant to be printed out or stored digitally. Output Documents are useful for creating external records of case data, as well as creating formatted documents such as letters, bills and receipts. Output Documents are generated from HTML templates and can contain variables, which are auto-inserted when the Output Document is generated as a step when running a case. Output Documents are generated as PDF (Portable Document Format) and/or DOC (Word document)files, so they can be easily opened and printed using Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Office.
If the Output Document is generated as a PDF file, the TCPDF library can be used to generate the PDF file.

Versioning is useful if the same output document is created at multiple steps in a case. This option allows a record to be kept of how the document's data changes over the course of a case, which is useful for maintaining audit trails.

  * Destination Path: Enter the name of the folder where the output document should be stored.
  * Tags: Enter the name of the identifying tag(s) that will be associated with this output document. To specify more than one tag name, separate each tag name with commas.  Tags are really useful when looking for output documents in the ProcessMaker database.
  * oBy clicking on the generated file link: Select whether the file will be downloaded or opened in the browser window.
  * Download the file:Download the file directly to the local computer. By choosing this option, the browser will automatically download the file. This is the recommended option when creating output documents.
