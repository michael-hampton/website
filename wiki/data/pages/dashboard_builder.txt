**Dashboard Builder**

Dashboards are speific for the buisness using the applications and therefore the dashboard provides some basic examples of dashboard widgets that could be used. The system
comes with its own pre-build dashboard framework which has been built to allow developers to easily build their own widgets. Dashboards can be assigned to one or more users. 
There also a dashboard builder which will take the data passed to it and convert it into a sepcified chart type (eg bar, pie table)
