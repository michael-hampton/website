**Email Servers**
Easyflow can be configured to send out email to keep its users apprised of new cases in their Inbox and notify them at specified times while running cases. It is possible to create and configure more than one server to send out these emails. This page explains the settings to configure EasyFlow to use the email servers.

This option sends email using the PHPMailer program. Select this option to use an email server which supports the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP). If your organization does not have its own email server (such as sendmail, postfix, or exim), use an external email service (such as Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail) which supports SMTP. If using an external email service, check the configuration information below for Hotmail, Yahoo or Gmail, or see this list for the SMTP configuration of other email providers.
