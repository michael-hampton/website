**Report Tables**

The information entered into form fields and case variables are JSON arrays, which are not easy to access with database queries. Report Tables are designed to export the data from the workflow database, so that data can be easily accessed by standard SQL queries or external applications.
Each time a new case is created, another record will be added to the Report Table. That record will be updated each time a form is submitted in the case.
