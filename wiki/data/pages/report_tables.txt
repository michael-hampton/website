**Report Tables**

The application data that is entered in forms and case variables are stored as JSON arrays in Mysql tables. JSON support in Mysql is still limited and therefore manipulating data through queries can sometimes be difficult.  Report Tables are designed to take data  and store it in custom built report tables and individual columns, so that data can be easily accessed by standard SQL queries.

Each time a new case is created, providing a report table has been configured for the workflow, another record will be added to the Report Table. That record will be updated each time a form is submitted in the case.
