**Overview**

The Case Tracker allows an external user to log into ProcessMaker and review the progress and information of a case. The external user can check:

  * Where the case is. (Completed tasks, Pending tasks/Not executed and Tasks in progress)
  * A summary of the derivations and information related to the specific case.
  * Case History.
  * Message History.

In this new window several options will appear. Like shown in the image below, the Case Tracker defines what kind of information the external user should be able to view. The external user can see either the whole workflow or only defined stages of the workflow. Likewise the external user can have access to the routing history or message history, or both.

Case Tracker Properties

Users can track information about where the case is and about case forms and documents. 


Case Tracker Objects

It is also possible to define which process objects can be tracked by the external user in the Case Tracker. As seen in the image below, two available options are at hand: "Available Objects" and "Assigned Objects". Select which DynaForms, Input and Output Documents will be available to the external user through the Case Tracker.
